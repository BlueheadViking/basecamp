            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                GeoPic started as an idea that came up while playing with maps for work. As a UX designer, I needed to compare Mapbox styles at the same zoom level and location. Manually mocking this up felt tedious, so I decided to explore building it myself. AI is pretty good nowdays (2024) - how hard could it possibly be?
            </p>
            <p>
                Using ChatGPT and Mapbox, I started with getting a map to show up in a local .html file, I had done this for work and so didnt take too long. I played around with the Mapbox Styles a fair bit (I thought it was pretty cool) before soon realising that this project was quickly exceeding the pace that notepad could keep up with. Time to delve into Visual Studio Code - something I was not very familiar with (My jam is Figma)
            </p>
            <p>
                The first real step that made something real was using AI to create me a random selection of points around the globe. I tinkered with this a little, adding lines between all the markers, lines between the closest five markers, and then markers within a proximity, colouring by distance. This was pretty cool, I had always percieved mapping as a tough problem, but I had created a prototype in less than an hour. Fasinating.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a little fun mucking about, I decided to continue by generating some markers across New Zealand. It worked well enough for a proof of concept, though the markers weren’t confined to country borders and weren’t very accurate. It was good enough to help me realise some of my ideas
            </p>
            <p>
                The timing couldn’t have been better—AI tools were rapidly evolving. partway through the project, GPT introduced beta versions of canvas and reasoning capabilities, and suddenly, prototyping became much more efficient. I could view all my code on one canvas and make changes to it without needing to copy paste my whole codebase. (apologies to all of the actual developers I just offended)
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, my goal was simple: build something real that people might use. But as the project progressed, the vision shifted. I started imagining GeoPic as a platform for location-based photography competitions or a way to showcase community-nominated photos from around the world, this quickly migrated to a way to show my photos geographically. The more I worked on it the more inspired I got.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting the map up and running was the first milestone. But I couldn't use random locations forever, and I knew for sure I wasn't going to do a commit every time I needed to update the data. I used Google Sheets for data storage - this also allowed me to update data, and copy paste real world locations. Is this the start of a back-end?
            </p>
            <p>
                A coworker introduced me to the live preview feature on VS Code, which became a game-changer—before that, I was clumsily building and uploading code just to test it!
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment I saw my first functional, interactive map felt incredible. It was no longer just a mockup; it was real. I could pan around and see real-world locations. Mapping has always excited me, so this was a big deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, I later discovered that Mapbox has a built-in style preview feature that could have simplified my initial work experiment. In hindsight, though, I’m glad I didn’t know—it pushed me to learn more by doing.
            </p>

            <h3>Second Steps: Making the Map Smarter</h3>
            <h4>Adding GPS Data</h4>
            <p>
                I opted to store GPS data in Google Sheets, which allowed for easy updates without needing to commit new files. This also made the project more scalable—anyone could add to the sheet and see updates in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I integrated some GPS data. I looked through a few datasets, and didnt find anything until I came accross a "Cities of NZ" dataset. Good enough for now, albeit people I showed thought I was building a city finder app.. I toyed with the idea of linking it to a live database but I was out of my depth on that one, and there were more exciting things to work on. Initially, I used a bounding box to zoom to clusters of points, but it quickly became clear that this approach wasn’t great. The box was too big, the data too clustered, and it wasn’t as nice looking as I hoped. I focusing the zoom on Dunedin, NZ, my home city, proved a better compromise. Dunedin has close markers and a unique road layout with the Octagon, which made it visually interesting for testing, and quite cool to have the starting point of the software be where I was developing it. Eventually I would like to have it zoom to the users home region.
            </p>

            <h3>Reinventing Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than relying on the typical click-on-marker selection method, I wanted something different, especially for mobile users. I created a system where users could pan the map, and points were selected based on proximity. I found this feature on the cursor in BattleBit Remastered which was similar and took inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                This came with challenges. I initially had the selector line snap to the closest marker, but this was sometimes off the screen, doing a radus around the centre of the screen was good in theory but when very zoomed in, or very zoomed out it fell apart. After sleeping on it, I eventually clicked and took a percentage of the screen width. This worked well and was very intuitive over desktop and mobile.
            </p>

            <h3>Third Steps: Adding Interactivity</h3>
            <p>
                GeoPic started coming to life with the addition of interactive features. At first, proximity to a point simply displayed a bit of text at the top of the map. It was neat but felt underwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then added a dialog with a thumbnail, title, and location. This worked better, especially on mobile, but placing the dialog at the bottom created design challenges. It felt unbalanced, especially with longer text, and didn’t align with typical mapping software layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving the dialog to the top-right corner solved this problem. It gave me more room for images, better styling options, and a cleaner design. I also added fullscreen image previews, letting users view high-quality photos and navigate between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To add depth, I introduced the option for photographers to include a story or blurb about their photo. Users could even link their Instagram handles, creating a layer of attribution and a potential "clout" incentive to participate.
            </p>

            <h3>Fourth Steps: Refining and Polishing</h3>
            <h4>Map Styling</h4>
            <p>
                With functionality in place, I turned to visual design. I lowered the contrast of the map to shift focus to the markers while still providing spatial context. Simplifying the map made it more engaging and less visually overwhelming.
            </p>
            <h4>Animations and Mobile Design</h4>
            <p>
                I added subtle animations—a sliding dialog with a soft bounce—to make interactions feel smoother and more polished. On mobile, I implemented a sliding drawer for the dialog, which kept it from taking over the entire screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                One idea I didn’t get to implement was a visual cue for scrolling, like showing half an image in the drawer. It would have been a nice touch, but I’ll save it for a future iteration.
            </p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <h4>Unexpected Joy in Building</h4>
            <p>
                What surprised me most was how invested I became in the project. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, jotting down new ideas day and night. The process of creating something functional, not just designing it, was incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            <h4>The Power of AI and Tools</h4>
            <p>
                This project wouldn’t have been possible for me a few years ago. Tools like ChatGPT and advancements in AI have made it easier for people like me, who understand the concepts but lack coding expertise, to bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <h4>The Role of UX Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
                My UX experience proved invaluable. It helped me communicate ideas effectively, whether through mockups or CSS tweaks to refine the layout. The ability to articulate problems and solutions sped up the development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                GeoPic has been a journey of curiosity, creativity, and growth. It’s far from perfect, but it’s real—and that’s what makes it exciting. Whether it’s used for photography competitions or something else entirely, GeoPic is proof of what’s possible when you dive into a project with an open mind and the right tools.
