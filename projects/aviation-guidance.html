                A ground-up redesign of Tabula’s aviation guidance system—making flight safer, smarter, and more user-friendly for New Zealand’s top agricultural pilots. From entrenched legacy tech to a best-in-class experience.

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                In 2024, I joined the AirVision project just two months before a major release—first as a user tester, then as lead UX designer. The brief: overhaul our core aviation guidance tablet to replace aging, unreliable legacy hardware and software, and deliver a product ready for real pilots, real flights, and real stakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is used for two critical purposes: recording proof of fertiliser and spray application, and providing live guidance patterns to pilots—helping them fly the safest, most efficient lines over complex farmland.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stakes were high: missing the release window could set the business back a year in training, onboarding, and sales. The product needed to feel robust, intuitive, and ready to fly—right out of the box.
            </p>

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <p>
                AirVision’s redesign surfaced unique challenges I needed to manage closely:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legacy dependencies</strong> — The original product (Flight3) was highly flexible, but unreliable and difficult to update. It generated high support volume, yet was still loved by many pilots for its configurability.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex, busy users</strong> — Agricultural pilots are expert, busy, and deeply resistant to change. They operate at high speed, low altitude, and every finger is already doing something critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Hazard avoidance</strong> — Powerlines are one of the leading causes of fatal aviation accidents. Any new system had to make safety more visible, not less.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple pilots, shared aircraft</strong> — Each pilot needs to bring their own setup and preferences, with no time wasted on reconfiguration.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time hardware integration</strong> — The device needed to work seamlessly with in-cockpit hardware, with minimal distraction or extra steps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These risks had the potential to derail the project if not surfaced and solved early.
            </p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                My role evolved quickly from user tester to solo designer, working end-to-end—from domain research and pilot interviews, to hands-on design, prototyping, and detailed documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                With no prior aviation experience, I had to get up to speed fast. I became a domain translator: interviewing pilots, shadowing product owners, and decoding legacy logic into usable, modern flows. I managed everything from early concepts through to design QA and handoff.
            </p>

            <h3>Research & Early Work</h3>
            <p>
                I began by diving deep into existing user feedback, legacy support tickets, and sitting in the cockpit with real users. I mapped out the most common flight patterns, pilot pain points, and job types handled by the legacy system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Empathy interviews quickly highlighted subtle but powerful insights: experienced pilots often voiced satisfaction, but non-verbal cues and their workflow hacks told a different story. Many critical features were hard to use, or buried in deep settings. I learned to pay attention to how pilots said things, not just what they said.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frustration when things worked differently than expected</li>
                <li>Some features functional but not actually useful</li>
                <li>Hidden UX gaps that could be fixed without losing power or flexibility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                One feature was consistently flagged: the <strong>Guidance Card</strong>. The old version was powerful but overwhelming, and hard to use in-flight.
            </p>

            <h3>Designing the Guidance Card</h3>
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/aviation-guidance-001.png" alt="Guidance Card UI - Feature Example" class="full-width-image">
            </div>
            <p>
                The new Guidance Card needed to let pilots:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recall and reuse previous guidance lines</li>
                <li>Set up multiple A–B lines per job</li>
                <li>Quickly generate new flight patterns on the go</li>
                <li>Choose whether to guide an entire job or a specific block</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All in a UI that was accessible, glanceable, and easy to operate at 250kph just meters above the ground.
            </p>
            <div class="image-wrapper">

            </div>
            <p>
                I mapped every existing and proposed pattern as a “logic tree,” diagramming the decisions and required inputs for each setup—whether a simple straight line or a complex multi-block pattern. By isolating the most common use cases, I could streamline the UI for 80% of workflows, while still supporting the rest as advanced options.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                I then moved to Figma to iterate on layouts and interactions, with a core goal: <strong>keep it all on one screen</strong>, no scrolling needed, even as we doubled the functionality.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                User testing and field feedback were essential. I tried both the simplest and most complex versions, tweaking buttons, quick actions, and visual cues. Pilot feedback was clear: job-based guidance should be default, with block-based as a power feature; and heading visibility is critical for coordinating between multiple pilots and reducing the risk of overlap or collision.
            </p>
            <div class="image-wrapper">

            </div>
            <p>
                The final design supported all key patterns, was field-tested for clarity, and made guidance setup genuinely quick and safe for any pilot. Here’s a look at a few of the combinations:

            </div>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The AirVision Guidance Revamp shipped as a radically more usable product. Pilots could now quickly transfer settings, avoid the old system’s pitfalls, and operate safely at speed. The project re-established trust with both the business and our most demanding users, showing that real UX work makes a measurable difference—even in specialist, high-risk domains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key outcomes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pilot settings can be carried between aircraft, saving precious setup time</li>
                <li>Critical guidance and safety data are always at hand—no extra steps</li>
                <li>Support calls are down, confidence is up, and feedback from the field has been strong</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                Designing for aviation is humbling. The people using your product are skilled, direct, and have zero time for fluff. Empathy means listening between the lines and seeing past what users say to what they really need.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process sharpened my ability to rapidly map complexity, align on what matters, and deliver real, user-focused improvements—on time, and in the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m proud of what we shipped and grateful for the lessons learned working at the intersection of safety, technology, and human factors.
