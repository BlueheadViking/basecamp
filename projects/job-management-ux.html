                I was tasked with designing a new job management system to replace the existing product. Here is how it went.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Tabula Live is to be the eventual full replacement of the existing Proof of Placement and Job management system. The existing system has its warts, but is a well-established player in the world of job management. Since its inception, it has had over 90 million hectares worth of work put through it - enough to cover a rugby pitch 33 million times. This product has sculpted and led the agricultural job management industry and is the foundation on which Tabula's success has been built. It would be hard to replace such a product, but there was a gap for the next generation of Agricultural Job management.</p>
            

            
            <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
            <p>The goal? Design and build the next generation job management system, capable of being built onto and heavily used for the next 10 years. To help with this, some key objectives were set.</p>
        
            
            <ul>
            <li>Must be scalable</li>
            <li>Must be specific</li>
            <li>Must collect as much information as possible</li>
            <li>Must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The project was prioritized because the existing system was beginning to become delicate. Ten years of technology change was taking its toll. While this didn’t have an effect on its daily life, it meant that changing anything introduced risk, not ideal for such an important product.</p>
            
            <p>Job management is just a section of the work to do in Tabula Live. Tabula Live will eventually take over all of Tabula’s current operations including reporting, device management, GPS tracking, proof of placement, and guidance systems.</p>
            
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>On this project, my role was UX/UI/Product Designer. I covered:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Customer Interviews</li>
            <li>Interface Design</li>
            <li>User Experience</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>We needed to do more than spreading and spraying</li>
            <li>Not all jobs have the same components</li>
            <li>Customization was more important than expected</li>
            <li>More and more operators were using mobile devices to do their job management</li>
            <li>Every contractor said they weren’t good with technology</li>
            <li>Customers knew the job management process better than most Tabula Staff</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>From the research period, it was clear that there were some pain points.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>TMO was built for a very defined customer, spreading contractors (and it served them very well!)</li>
            <li>A user could create a job from different places in TMO and would go through different workflows</li>
            <li>Job creation workflow was complex for even simple jobs</li>
            <li>Workflow and UI were not intuitive for new/long-term sporadic users</li>
            <li>Didn’t scale well</li>
            <li>Catered to power users who had gone on a steep learning curve</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>One particularly challenging pain point was not at the customer end - but rather internally. Before me, several designers had attempted to tackle this complex problem. Each design and implementation had taken a toll on the remaining team. Having a new designer (me!) on the project to redesign it again did not fill the team with hope. To combat this, I put together research, presentations, and got the team together to align everyone. Slide decks took a lot of time, but the hive mindset afterward was invaluable.

            <h3>User Experience</h3>
            <p>In terms of UX, I had a few clear ideas of how I wanted it improved.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ability to create a job from where it makes the most sense</li>
            <li>Ability to scale and be ready for different industries with different needs</li>
            <li>Make the simple easy, and the complex possible</li>
            <li>Collect high-quality data to make informed decisions later</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Fair to say, I succeeded. Jobs could be created from the main area the user lives - the main map, as well as within the Jobs tab. Each job started by selecting an activity, be it spreading or spraying to start, but could eventually be configured to do pest control, surveying, fuel transport, the list goes on.</p>

            <h3>Key Challenge: Variable Rate Jobs</h3>
            <p>A key challenge I faced was that we currently had a complex way of handling variable rate jobs (jobs where fertilizer gets applied at different rates across an area) - Analytics showed that it was not used much at all, and the general consensus was that it was an underused feature and shouldn’t be prioritized.</p>
            
            <p>Halfway through, the government released a new scheme where farmers had to report on all synthetic fertilizer applied on farms. This paired with COVID-19 driving fertilizer prices 5-10x higher than before. The insight? Farmers want their fertilizer to go further. As a team, we decided that we should place importance on allowing farmers to decide what quantity of fertilizer they want where.</p>
            
            <h3>Multi-Rate Job Creation</h3>
            <p>This led to a fairly extensive short project on adding multi-rate to the job creation process. We needed to cater to two key user stories:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>As a farmer</strong>, I want to define the amount of fertilizer I have upfront, then divide it between a set of paddocks because I have already bought the fertilizer, and I want to use it as efficiently as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>As a farmer</strong>, I want to set the rate that the fertilizer needs to go on a set of paddocks so that I have enough grass to feed my animals.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This meant that I needed to have a system that could either calculate the total or set it for a selected group of paddocks. An early mockup allowed the user to create block-groups to assign a rate/total to. This made sense, but was the wrong choice. It went against the ethos of making the simple easy and the complex possible. This workflow forced every farmer that created a spreading job to add a block group (even if there was only one!).</p>
            
            <p>A second implemented iteration had more time spent on the UX, in terms of workflow and button clicks. I am proud of how it turned out. Key differences it had over the existing system were:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Users could flick between “by total” and “by rate” easily without losing data</li>
            <li>Users could carry on with the simple workflow of all the blocks having the same rate/total, and choose to go deeper by selecting “Multi-Rate Job”</li>
            <li>Visual display of rate was indicated by adding more black or white to the requested block (Lighter = Less, Darker = More)</li>
            <li>Users could start an order like normal, add blocks with a rate to the job, and then move into multi-rate. The existing set of blocks and rates would be wrapped up into the first block group</li>
            <li>When there were two or more groups, selecting the dropdown would grey out any other block group on the map, so it was clear which the user was editing</li>
            </ul>
