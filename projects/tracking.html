            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                Any business trying to get off the ground has to move fast. In those early years, every bit of tech
                energy is spent shipping features to land the next sale. After multiple pivots, one-offs, and quick
                fixes, the user experience inevitably starts to show the strain.
            </p>
            <p>
                That messy, high-velocity phase is vital—and it’s always a little bit thrilling. But eventually, an
                opportunity comes along to use all that knowledge and redesign for the future: to build the next
                generation of software that can lead the company for the next 10 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that moment came for our core job management product, I jumped at it. Here’s how I approached
                rethinking the platform for the modern, mobile, and increasingly tech-savvy agricultural sector.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>
                Drawing on everything I’d learned from years of real-world user feedback, I made several foundational
                decisions to guide the new system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mobile-first, mapping-first</strong> – The new generation of farmers and contractors are
                    embracing digital tools. By designing for mobile from the start (and mapping as the default), we
                    created an experience that feels at home in the field—and equally powerful on desktop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fat finger friendly</strong> – In every empathy interview, users brought up frustration with
                    cramped UIs. Every tap target, button, and list item was sized for big hands and fast action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the simple easy, the complex possible</strong> – Most users rely on just a few key
                    workflows. The platform prioritises clarity and intuitiveness for the first 80% of tasks, while
                    still offering deep controls for power users (who, in ag, really love complexity).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Build to scale</strong> – Scar tissue from years of squeezing features into awkward spaces
                    taught me to always make room for the future. New features and data types have clear, logical places
                    to go—reducing future technical debt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Responsive by default</strong> – It’s table stakes, but worth noting: every screen and
                    feature works seamlessly from phone to desktop.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <em>*Cue number crunching, whiteboard scribbling, shower wall sketches, and notebook brainstorming.
                    Here’s what emerged.*</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>A mapping-first approach:</strong> Users instantly see their jobs, vehicles, and properties the
                moment they open the app.
            </p>

                are just a tap away.
